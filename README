#Street Map
###Feature
1. Framework and library: Knockout, jquery
2. Use Wikipedia and Google Map API
3. It's really easy to understand the ui, I just implement the minimum requirements.
4. I write very very detailed comment in code, so there is nothing to say, just have fun.

5. And last, I must complain that it is so annoying to use Knockout data-bind and the f****** observable. WebStorm did not give me hint when I was typing data-bind in HTML
 <br>React.js and its JSX is much better.
