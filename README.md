#Street Map
###Feature
1. Framework and library: Knockout, jquery
2. Use Wikipedia and Google Map API
3. Open index.html to use, ViewModel.js control the searchBar and map.js control the google maps.
4. It's really easy to understand the ui, I just implement the minimum requirements.
5. I write very very detailed comment in code, so there is nothing to say, just have fun.

5. And last, I must complain that it is so annoying to use Knockout data-bind and the f****** observable. WebStorm did not give me hint when I was typing data-bind in HTML
 <br>React.js and its JSX is much better.
