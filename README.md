#Street Map
###Feature
1. Framework and library: Knockout, jquery
2. Use Wikipedia and Google Map API
3. Open index.html to use, ViewModel.js control the searchBar and map.js control the google maps.
4. It's really easy to understand the ui, I just implement the minimum requirements.
5. I write very very detailed comment in code, so there is nothing to say, just have fun.
